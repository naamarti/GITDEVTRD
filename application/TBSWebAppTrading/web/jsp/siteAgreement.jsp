							    Buyer's execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the purchase of the Class A Units constitute valid and binding obligations of the Buyer
							    enforceable in accordance with its terms. The execution of and performance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with its

							    agreement, written or oral, to which the Buyer is a party or by which it or any of its properties is bound, or any decree, judgment, order, statute, rule

							    pursuant to any written notice, instrument, request, consent, certificate, document, letter, opinion, order, resolution or other writing hereunder without
							    being required to determine the authenticity of such document, the correctness of any fact stated therein, the propriety of the service thereof or the
							    capacity, identity or authority of any party purporting to sign or deliver such document. The Company and the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility for
							    the contents of any such writing contemplated herein and may rely without any liability upon the contents thereof.

											    (i) Any unresolved controversy or claim arising out of, in connection with, under or relating to this Agreement, shall be
											    submitted to arbitration (the "Arbitration") before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") using the Securities Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules")
											    then in effect. In the event that the Parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator within the period provided by the AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall be
											    selected by the AAA (the "Arbitrator").
											</p>
											<p align="left">
											    (ii) The arbitration shall take place in Bergen County, New Jersey. Judgment upon any award rendered in such arbitration will be binding and may be entered
											    in any court having jurisdiction thereof including for this purpose the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, Bergen County, or the United States
											    District Court for the District of New Jersey. All Parties agree and consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the aforementioned courts for all
											    purposes relating to the Arbitration including any equitable relief, and the entry of judgment upon, and enforcement of, any award.
											</p>
											<p align="left">
											    (iii) The Arbitrator shall be required to provide in writing to the parties the basis for the award or order of such arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall have
											    no power and authority to award punitive, exemplary, incidental and consequential (including without limitation lost profits) damages in favor of one Party

											    equitable relief, and impose sanctions upon any Party to any such Arbitration; provided that, no Party to the arbitration may seek, and the Arbitrator
											    shall not (and shall not be entitled or authorized to) award, punitive, aggravated or exemplary damages. Each Party shall bear its own legal costs and
											    expenses in connection with the Arbitration; <strong>provided, however, that</strong> the Arbitrator shall make an award of legal fees, and all other costs
											    and expenses of the Arbitration to the prevailing party as part of any Arbitration award including the filing fees for the Arbitration. The Arbitrator's
											    fees shall be divided equally between the Parties.
											</p>
											<p align="left">
											    (iv) The Parties hereto agree that all Arbitration proceedings hereunder, as well as the fact of their occurrence, shall be kept confidential by the
											    Parties hereto and may only be disclosed to their personal representatives and legal and other professional advisors or as required by law and insofar as
											    is necessary to obtain, confirm, correct, vacate or enforce the decision or award. In the event of a breach of the preceding sentence, the Arbitrator shall
											    be authorized to assess damages and each of the Parties hereto consents to the expansion of the scope of Arbitration for such purpose. The Arbitrator shall
											    have authority to grant injunctive relief, award specific performance, and other forms of equitable relief, and impose sanctions upon any Party to any such
											    Arbitration; provided that, no Party to the arbitration may seek, and the Arbitrator shall not (and shall not be entitled or authorized to) award,
											    punitive, aggravated or exemplary damages.
